Working with the Sandbox
========================

By default, a flatpak has extremely limited access to the host environment. This includes:

* No access to any host files except the runtime, the app and ``~/.var/app/$APPID``. Only the last of these is writable.
* No access to the network.
* No access to any device nodes (apart from ``/dev/null``, etc).
* No access to processes outside the sandbox.
* Limited syscalls.  For instance, apps can't use nonstandard network socket types or ptrace other processes.
* Limited access to the session D-Bus instance - an app can only own its own name on the bus.
* No access to host services like X, system D-Bus, or PulseAudio.

Most applications will need access to some of these resources in order to be useful, and flatpak provides a number of ways to give an application access to them. The ``build-finish`` command is the simplest of these. As was seen in a previous example, this can be used to add access to graphics sockets and network resources::

  $ flatpak build-finish dictionary2 --socket=x11 --share=network --command=gnome-dictionary

These arguments translate into several properties in the application metadata file::

  [Application]
  name=org.gnome.Dictionary
  runtime=org.gnome.Platform/x86_64/3.22
  sdk=org.gnome.Sdk/x86_64/3.22
  command=gnome-dictionary

  [Context]
  shared=network;
  sockets=x11;

Note that in this example access to the filesystem wasn't granted. This can be tested by installing the resulting application and running::

  $ flatpak run --command=ls org.gnome.Dictionary ~/
  
``build-finish`` allows a whole range of resources to be added to an application. Run ``flatpak build-finish --help`` to view the full list.

There are several ways to override the permissions that are set in an application's metadata file. One of these is to override them using flatpak run, which accepts the same parameters as ``build-finish``. For example, this will let the Dictionary application see your home directory::

  $ flatpak run --filesystem=home --command=ls org.gnome.Dictionary ~/
  
``flatpak run`` can also be used to permanently override an application's permissions::

  $ flatpak --user override --filesystem=home org.gnome.Dictionary
  $ flatpak run --command=ls org.gnome.Dictionary ~/
  
It is also possible to remove permissions using the same method. You can use the following command to see what happens when access to the filesystem is removed, for example::

  $ flatpak run --nofilesystem=home --command=ls org.gnome.Dictionary ~/

Useful sandbox permissions
--------------------------

Flatpak provides an array of options for controlling sandbox permissions. The following are some of the most useful.

Grant access to files::

  --filesystem=host    # All files
  --filesystem=home    # Home directory
  --filesystem=home:ro # Home directory, read-only
  --filesystem=/some/dir --filesystem=~/other/dir # Paths
  --filesystem=xdg-download # The XDG download directory
  --nofilesystem=...   # Undo some of the above

Allow the application to show windows using X11::

  --socket=x11 --share=ipc

Note: ``–share=ipc`` means that the sandbox shares IPC namespace with the host. This is not necessarily required, but without it the X shared memory extension will not work, which is very bad for X performance.

Allow OpenGL rendering::

  --device=dri

Allow the application to show windows using Wayland::

  --socket=wayland

Allow the application to play sounds using PulseAudio::

  --socket=pulseaudio

Allow the application to access the network::

  --share=network

Note: giving network access also grants access to all host services listening on abstract Unix sockets (due to how network namespaces work), and these have no permission checks. This unfortunately affects e.g. the X server and the session bus which listens to abstract sockets by default. A secure distribution should disable these and just use regular sockets.

Allow the application talk to a named service on the session bus::

  --talk-name=org.freedesktop.secrets

Allow the application talk to a named service on the system bus::

  --system-talk-name=org.freedesktop.GeoClue2

Allow the application unlimited access to all of D-Bus::

  --socket=system-bus --socket=session-bus

Filesystem permissions:

===================================================  ====================================
``--filesystem=host``                                Access all files
``--filesystem=home``                                Access the home directory
``--filesystem=home:ro``                             Access the home directory, read-only
``--filesystem=/some/dir --filesystem=~/other/dir``  Access paths
``--filesystem=xdg-download``                        Access the XDG download directory
``--nofilesystem=...``                               Undo some of the above
===================================================  ====================================

Other permissions:

===============================================  ===========================================
``--socket=x11 --share=ipc``                     Show windows using X11 [1]
``--device=dri``                                 OpenGL rendering
``--socket=wayland``                             Show windows using Wayland
``--socket=pulseaudio``                          Play sounds using PulseAudio
``--share=network``                              Access the network [2]
``--talk-name=org.freedesktop.secrets``          Talk to a named service on the session bus
``--system-talk-name=org.freedesktop.GeoClue2``  Talk to a named service on the system bus
``--socket=system-bus --socket=session-bus``     Unlimited access to all of D-Bus
