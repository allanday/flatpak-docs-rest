Welcome to Flatpak's documentation!
===================================

This covers everything you need to know to build and distribute applications as Flatpaks. The docs start with introduction to the basic concepts and a simple app building tutorial, before moving on to cover automated building and repository hosting.

Example tutorials are used throughout. To complete them, it is necessary to have ``flatpak`` and ``flatpak-builder`` installed on your system. flatpak.org provides `details on how to do this< http://flatpak.org/getting.html>`_.
